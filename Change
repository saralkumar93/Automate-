Here’s where you need to make changes in the script based on your actual environment:


---

1. Rubrik Cluster Information

rubrik_url = "https://<rubrik-cluster-ip>"

Change to your actual Rubrik cluster URL, for example:

rubrik_url = "https://rubrik01.mycompany.com"


---

2. API Token

auth_token = "<your-api-token>"

Replace with a valid API token from the Rubrik UI:

auth_token = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1..."

Do not include Bearer in the token itself—it's already handled in the headers.


---

3. Report ID

report_id = "<report-id>"

You need to find the report ID either:

From the Rubrik UI: Sometimes available in the URL after selecting a saved report.

Or by API:


curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" https://rubrik-cluster/api/internal/report

Once found:

report_id = "123abc456def"


---

4. SMTP (Email) Settings

smtp_server = "smtp.example.com"
smtp_port = 587
smtp_username = "smtp_user@example.com"
smtp_password = "smtp_password"

Replace with your actual SMTP email configuration, such as:

smtp_server = "smtp.office365.com"
smtp_port = 587
smtp_username = "reportbot@yourcompany.com"
smtp_password = "yourStrongPassword!"


---

5. Email Addresses

email_sender = "sender@example.com"
email_recipient = "recipient@example.com"

Update with your email and the recipient's email:

email_sender = "reportbot@yourcompany.com"
email_recipient = "itmanager@yourcompany.com"


---

Optional: File Save Path

If you want to save the report in a specific directory:

save_dir = "/tmp"

Can be changed to:

save_dir = "C:/Reports"  # For Windows


---

Let me know if you want help getting the report ID via API or converting this to a Windows Task Scheduler format.
